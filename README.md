It is made using PHP, MySQL, Ajax, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. :zap:

It is useful for solving doubts among peers and friends while not disturbing the class. :speak_no_evil: It helps in inculcating the discipline among students during lectures and stop the urge to speak with friends. ü§´

## Working of the Application : 

To Register for the first time, the user has to provide their **Name**, ***email***, **password** and retype to **confirm password** and **gender** column for setting the default image. :lock:

For verification, an *email* will be sent which the user has to click in order to **initialize the application**. :email: :unlock:

Once the user has signed up, The *Login page* will contain only 2 parameters i.e., **emailID** and the **password**.:new: :key:
